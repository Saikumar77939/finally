# 6. Insights and Conclusion
print("\nüìå Add your insights and conclusions here based on the visualizations and statistics above.")

a="""Insights:
Hourly Ride Patterns:
-Most rides occur during peak commuting hours, typically between 5 PM and 9 PM, indicating high demand in the evening.
-There‚Äôs a noticeable dip in early morning hours (e.g., 2 AM ‚Äì 6 AM), which suggests lower ride activity during that period.

Day of Week Trends:
-Ride volume tends to increase toward the weekend, especially on Friday and Saturday, possibly due to social activities or outings.
-Weekday rides may indicate work or school commutes, whereas weekend patterns may reflect leisure or entertainment travel.

Data Quality:
-The dataset contained missing values and duplicates, which were successfully cleaned.
-The pickup datetime field was converted to proper datetime format for time-based analysis.


Conclusion:
The Uber ride dataset reveals clear patterns in human mobility behavior, especially around daily routines and weekly cycles.

Understanding when rides are most frequent can help Uber:
-Optimize driver availability
-Improve surge pricing models
-Enhance customer service during peak times

For deeper insights, further analysis can be done by incorporating:
-Pickup/dropoff locations (geospatial analysis)
-Trip durations and distances
-Fare amounts and customer ratings
